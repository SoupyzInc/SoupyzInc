  Thanks for peeking under the hood! It's pretty neat, right?

  I used <a href="https://github.com/ouuan">ouuan's</a> 
  <a href="https://github.com/ouuan/ouuan">README</a> as a guide 
  to setting up this repository's GitHub Actions to display the 
  below crypto prices.

  I'm glad you enjoyed my README enough to take a peak under 
  the hood! <3

<h2 align="center">Data Engineer - Bulls Racing</h2>
<details><summary>Click to expand summary!</summary>
•	<b><ins>Saved $2,495</ins></b> per year from the team’s budget by developing a bespoke tire data analysis program using MATLAB to substitute out-of-budget software such as OptimumTire.
<br>•	<b><ins>Justified purchasing of over $4,000 in new tires with 90 different graphs</ins></b> (FY vs SA and MZ vs SA) comparing different tire and rim combinations. Graphs also determined an optimal tire pressure of 10 PSI for our vehicle setup.
<br>•	Documented and maintain over 60 different sensors and 190 data channels that these sensors produce.
<br>•	Assisted in the design on the new wiring harness by calculating safety of lighter, lower-gauge wires in the safety circuit.
<br>•	Promoted to Junior Engineer for consistent daily dedication of progressive work towards the team. Consistently produced work that positively impacted the quality of our car. Junior Engineer is a steppingstone role to becoming a Design Lead or other Executive Board and leadership positions.
