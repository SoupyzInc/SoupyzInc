## Current Projects
### [Discord.Net Guide](https://github.com/SoupyzInc/Discord.Net-Guide)
A down to the point guide for making a Discord bot using the Discord.Net API. Created due to the lack of clear and concise tutorials on Discord.Net, with the goal of contributing back to the community.

### [FunkyBot](https://github.com/SoupyzInc/FunkyBot)
A simple general purpose C# discord bot written with Discord.Net for the FunkyZone server. Created to practice using the GutHub version control systems.
