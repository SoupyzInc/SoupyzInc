<!--
  Thanks for peeking under the hood! It's pretty neat right?

  While you are welcome to use this README as a guide, please
  DO NOT just blindly copy it. 1. It's never good to blindly 
  copy code you don't understand and 2. You may end up leaving
  my information in your README.

  I'm glad you enjoyed my README enough to take a peak under 
  the hood! <3

<p>Yes, "Matt" is fine too, whatever comes naturally to you. I'm 16, a rising senior in high school, and I have a programming 
addiction. I'm planning to pursue a master's in computer science and maybe a minor in math while I'm at it.<br>
