<!--
  Thanks for peeking under the hood! It's pretty neat, right?

  While you are welcome to use this README as a guide, please
  DO NOT just blindly copy it. 1. It's never good to blindly 
  copy code you don't understand and 2. You may end up leaving
  my information in your README.

  I used <a href="https://github.com/ouuan">ouuan's</a> 
  <a href="https://github.com/ouuan/ouuan">README</a> as a guide 
  to setting up this repository's GitHub Actions to display the 
  below crypto prices.

  I'm glad you enjoyed my README enough to take a peak under 
  the hood! <3

<p>Yes, "Matt" is fine too, whatever comes naturally to you. I'm 17, a senior in high school, and I have a programming addiction. I'm planning to pursue a PhD in computer science and a career in computer science research. I am currently researching about 📈 line charts.
