    Thanks for peeking under the hood! It's pretty neat right?

    While you are welcome to use this README as a guide, please
    DO NOT just blindly copy it. 1. It's never good to blindly 
    copy code you don't understand and 2. You may end up leaving
    my information in your README.

    I'm glad you enjoyed my README enough to take a peak under 
    the hood! <3

<p>Yes, "Matt" is fine too, whatever comes naturally to you. I'm 16, a rising senior in highschool, and I have a programming addiction. I'm planning to pursue a master's in computer science and maybe a minor in math while I'm at it.</p>
